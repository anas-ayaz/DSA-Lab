DSA 4th Semester Lab Work


In Lab 3 task 1, the program defines a templated List class with pure virtual functions for listing operations, making it an abstract class. The Derived class implements these functions, allowing elements to be added at the start and end, removed from both ends, and displayed. The main function creates a Derived object with an integer array, performs operations like inserting 0 at the start, 6 at the end, and removing elements from both ends, displaying the list after each step. However, the code has issues, such as an undefined Type, redundant variables, incorrect copy constructor logic, and a typo in the destructor.
