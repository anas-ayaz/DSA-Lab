DSA 4th Semester Lab Work

Lab 3 Task 1
The program defines a dynamic templated list using an abstract List class and a concrete Derived class that implements essential list operations. The addElementAtFirstIndex(T value) function inserts an element at the beginning by shifting existing elements, while addElementAtLastIndex(T value) adds an element at the end if space is available. The removeElementFromEnd() function removes and returns the last element, whereas removeElementFromStart() removes the first element by shifting the remaining elements. The display() function prints all elements in the list. In the main() function, a Derived object is created, elements are added at both ends, some are removed, and the list is displayed after each operation.

Lab 3 Task 2
This program implements a dynamic templated list using an abstract List class and a Derived class that provides various list operations. The addElementAtFirstIndex(t value) function inserts an element at the beginning by shifting existing elements, while addElementAtLastIndex(t value) appends an element at the end if space allows. The removeElementFromEnd() function removes and returns the last element, whereas removeElementFromStart() shifts elements left to remove the first element. The display() function prints the list, while empty() and full() check if the list is empty or full. The size() function returns the current list size. The insertAt(int index, t value) function inserts an element at a specific index, shifting elements accordingly. The last() function retrieves the last element without removing it, and search(t value) checks for an elementâ€™s presence. The operator= ensures proper assignment of list objects. The main() function demonstrates these operations by performing insertions, deletions, and displaying the list after each step.
